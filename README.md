# SANS ESCAPE!

Sheshu the elf dropped down into the underground. Being the greedy elf he is, he takes this opportunity to gather as many emeralds as possible.
However, while exploring, he meets a shady individual who went by the name Sans.. or individuai(s) rather?
Now, his sole objective is to escape the underground (ok maybe not sole. Who doesn't love a few juicy emeralds).

Stop reading and start escaping SANS!!
